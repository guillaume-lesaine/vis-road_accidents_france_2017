# vis-road_accidents_france_2017

This repository gathers the data crunching part of the work involved in writting the **Observable** notebook [Road Accidents in France, 2017](https://observablehq.com/@guillaume-lesaine/road-accidents-in-france-2017). This notebook presents a short study of the external causes of road accidents in France in 2017 such as types of roads, weather and time of the day. I use public data available at [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-de-donnees-accidents-corporels-de-la-circulation).

Available in this repository:
- The **Python** code relying on **pandas** to do the data crunching
- A few tests written with **Pytest**
- The source CSV data and the refined CSV files feeding the notebook
- A PDF file in French describing the content of the database
